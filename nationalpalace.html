        Home to the world's largest and arguably finest collection of Chinese art, this vast hoard covers treasures in painting, calligraphy, statuary, bronzes, lacquerware, ceramics, jade and religious objects. Some of the most popular items, such as the famous
        Jadeite Cabbage, are always on display – although check first that it's not on loan to the southern branch in Chiayi.
    </p>

    <p>
        The museum offers free guided tours in English at 10am and 3pm (book online or register in person about 20 minutes before, limited to 30 people). If you prefer to move about at your own pace, try an English headphone guide (NT$150). There is also a museum
        gift shop worth exploring.
    </p>
    <p>
        To reach the museum from Shilin MRT station, head out Exit 1 to Zhongzheng Rd and catch the R30 (red 30), minibus 18 or 19, or bus 255, 304 or 815. It's about 15 minutes to the museum. From Dazhi MRT station take bus B13 (brown 13).
